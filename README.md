## Hi there, this is Victor (aka Kiryu) ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student in Multiplatform App Development *(since 2023-24)* and a self-taught when I have free time. As much as they can teach in class there is always that extra edge that can be found, and I'm all for getting the grabs of it.

In order to push myself to secure all the knowledge I've gathered by both methods mentioned above, I'm going to try to make the best effort to share some projects here in GitHub, just to test and check myself and to see where I need to improve thanks to any feedback that you could give me (that I will trully appreciate, of course).

Also, so you can track my improvements and check what might be applied in every project, here is a list of the things that we are going to learn from this very first year to the last one (2026).

*note: bare in mind I'm from Spain and while I feel confortable speaking in English some of the tranlated namings on the list might not be 100% accurate, but I'll try to explain them the best I can (or I'll put it even later in this document). The names title below that appear on italic are of those which translation might be a bit... let's call it 'wonky'*

#### First year:
- HTML, CSS and XML
- Programming, with Java
- Development environments (I guess I can translate this to IDEs?)
- Basic hardware and commands (both Win and Linux), Windows and Linux permissions...

#### Second year:
- Databases
  - Probably PL/SQL for what I've heard from the teachers
  - More info to come
- Access to data
  - Presumably using Java
  - More info to come
- Interface development
  - More info to come
- English
  - Yes, the very language I'm writing in right now, but as you all know it is ~~almost~~ a MUST

#### Third year:
- *Multimedia programming and mobile devices*
  - *Android Studio with Java and maybe Unity with C#?*
  - More info to come
- *Programming of services and processes*
  - *Multithreading and multiprocess programming, programming using secure techniques...*
  - More info to come
- Business management systems
  - *For what I know so far: ERP-CRM*
  - More info to come
- Practice in a job environment
  - I think it reflect the idea better than 'Job environment practice'
- End of studies project
  - I have no idea what they will ask us to do in specific, but I guess it's going to be a project involving all we've learnt so far and its corresponding report and documentation
 
On the self-taught side of things, I'll be trying to post some other projects too, either in Java, because it's what we are using on class right now, or in other languages like C#, Python or any other that I find myself learning and using in a future.

But for now, this is still a work in progress and it will be updated every time I make a change. I will also try to keep the best order possible so everything is easy to find and in reach, but this is all susceptible to changes in the future. Who knows: maybe I could organize it all better, or find that some things are better in other way for the people to see if anyone is interested. Again: for now take all you see here with a pinch of salt.
